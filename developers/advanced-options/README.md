# Embed options

Until now, we've talked about customizing your schedule by [changing its colors](../../designers/customize-your-embed/change-colors.md), [fonts](../../designers/customize-your-embed/use-your-own-fonts.md) and [icons](../../designers/customize-your-embed/replace-icons.md). But there is more that you can do. For example, by adding extra options to the embed code we can \[show or hide components\]\({{&lt; relref "hide-components.md" &gt;}}\) and [set date formats](date-format.md).  
  
Most of these chapters are developer oriented. We will talk nerdy things like [browser support](../browser-support.md) and [caching](caching.md). Which can be daunting. But donâ€™t be afraid, there is useful information for everyone!
