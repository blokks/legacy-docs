When enabled, the [time indicator]({{< relref "basic-structure.md#time-indicator" >}}) is automatically scrolled into view, showing speakers and bands that are now playing. This option works on desktop and only during days of the event.

<span class='note'>Sometimes this feature can be cumbersome though. For example, when your schedule is embedded on a one-page website. In that case you simply donâ€™t want to auto scroll the page.</span>

| Option | Values | Default value |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| `data-auto-scroll` | `true` `false` | `true`|

### Example

```html
<script	defer src='[path-to-embed]'
  data-auto-scroll='false'>
</script>
```
