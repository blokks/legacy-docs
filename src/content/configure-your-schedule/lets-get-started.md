Until now we talked about designing your schedule by [changing its colors]({{< relref "change-colors.md" >}}), [fonts]({{< relref "add-own-fonts.md" >}}) and [replacing icons]({{< relref "replace-icons.md" >}}). But there is more we can do. For example, by adding options to the embed code we can [enable and disable features]({{< relref "hide-elements.md" >}}), [update copy]({{< relref "update-copy.md" >}}) and [set the date format]({{< relref "date-format.md" >}}).

Most these chapters are developer oriented. We will talk about nerdy things like [browser support]({{< relref "which-browsers-are-supported.md" >}}), [service workers]({{< relref "offline.md" >}}) and [caching]({{< relref "caching.md" >}}). Which can be daunting for designers at first sight. Don’t be afraid though, there is useful info for you too!
