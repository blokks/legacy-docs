When starting a new template you can choose to [use one of our existing layouts](choose-your-layout.md) or decide to create your own. In that case set the [`data-layout`](http://configure/layouts) option of your embed code to `custom`. This will strip all layout properties from the schedule, giving you a clean slate.
