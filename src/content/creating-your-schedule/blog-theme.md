# Blog theme
The Blog theme renders markdown, HTML and text files. Each file you include will appear on the homepage and be rendered as its own post.

If you post a lot you can append the time to the date (we use military time, way more precise) separated by a dash. If you want to add a title to the filename put a space after the timestamp. Here are some sample filenames:
