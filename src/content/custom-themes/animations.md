The `animation` property can be used to animate any CSS property such as `color`, `background-color`, `width`, `height`, etc. Each animation needs to be defined with the `@keyframes` at-rule which is then called with the `animation` property, like so:

```css
.element {
  animation: present-element 300ms ease-out-back;
  transform: translate3d(0, 100px, 0);
}

@keyframes present-element {
  to {
    transform: none;
  }
}
```

## Animating modals & alerts
The *Activity Details* components and all alerts animate in when they appear. To replace the animation with another one, you only need to update the start value of the `transform` property. 

For example, here's how to make the modal bounce onto the screen:

```css
.element {
  transform: scale3d(0.9, 0.9, 1);
}
```
You can configure your `animation` by setting its sub-properties. This lets you tweak the timing, duration, and other details of how the animation sequence should progress. Find out [more about CSS animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations).

## Animating other elements
Modals and alerts are currently the only components that have animation. But this doesnâ€™t mean that you are limited to just those components. Matter of fact, [Embassy of Dutch Creativity](https://blokks.co/schedules/embassy-of-dutch-creativity) spiced up their schedule with all kinds of animations. Feel free to add animation to your schedule!
