Besides colors, fonts and sizes, there are more *CSS variables* for you to change. To get a list of all properties, right click anywhere on your page, open the *Developer tools* by clicking *Inspect* and select the `<html>` tag:

<span class='note'>Pro-tip: Changes made to CSS variables are rendered live while adjusting them in the Developer tools. Note that these changes are temporary and will be lost when refreshing or closing the window. So don’t forget to copy and paste them in your code when you’re done.</span>
