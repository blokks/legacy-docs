## Desktop
On desktop, the embed has two layouts: the first direction being the *column* layout where stages are arranged horizontally. This is the default direction of the embed. The second is the *row* layout where stages are stacked vertically.

![Row vs. column layout](images/choose-your-layout-row-vs-column.gif)

You can change the layout direction at any time by switching the layout in the [embed tab]({{< relref "configure-your-embed.md" >}}) of our backend or by [setting it manually]({{< relref "layout.md" >}}) with the `data-layout` option:

```html
<script defer src='[path-to-embed]'
  data-blokks-id='[schedule-id]'
  data-layout='rows'>
</script>
```

A good example of the column layout is the schedule that [The Next Web](https://blokks.co/schedules/tnw2017) built. An example of the row layout was implemented by [De Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/evenementen/7/festival-der-vooruitgang/programma).

## Mobile
On mobile devices your schedule is automatically shown in a list view. However, users can switch back to the full schedule by rotating their device to *landscape mode*. The default breakpoint for switching between mobile and desktop view is **30em** or **480px**. This works best on all devices. If needed, you can [change this value](http://configure/breakpoints).

![Mobile layout](images/choose-your-layout-mobile.gif)

For events with a lot of stages and acts the list view can become quite long. Therefore, during the day or days of your event the mobile version of the embed will show the *Dashboard*. The *Dashboard* is a summary of acts that are playing now and coming up next. [Find out more about the Dashboard]({{< relref "basic-structure.md#dashboard" >}})

<span class='note'>Note: If you are [creating your own theme]({{< relref "custom-themes.md" >}}) and donâ€™t want to use the *column* or *row* layout, set the `data-layout` property to `custom`.</span>
