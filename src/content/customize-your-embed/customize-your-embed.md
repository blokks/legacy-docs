So, you’ve added all your days, stages, acts and you've embedded the schedule on your website. Pretty sweet! It’s time to style and configure your schedule to match it to your event branding so it fits perfectly within your website.

In the next chapters we'll explain how to [change the layout of your schedule]({{< relref "choose-your-layout.md" >}}) , [set its colors]({{< relref "change-colors.md" >}}) and [add your own fonts]({{< relref "add-own-fonts.md" >}}) & [icons]({{< relref "replace-icons.md" >}}).
