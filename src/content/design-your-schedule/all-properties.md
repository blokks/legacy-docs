Besides *colors* *fonts* and *sizes*, there are more *CSS variables* for you to change. To get a list of all properties, right click anywhere on your page, open the *Developer tools* by clicking *Inspect* and select the `<html>` tag:

<span class='note'>Pro-tip: Changes made to *CSS variables* are rendered live to screen while editting in the *Developer tools*. Note that these changes are temporary and will be lost when refreshing or closing the window. So don’t forget to copy/paste them when you’re done.</span>
