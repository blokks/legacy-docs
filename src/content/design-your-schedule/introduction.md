So you’ve added all days, stages and acts and embedded the schedule on your website ✌️. Now it’s time to style and configure your schedule so it matches your conference’s identity and it embeds perfectly within your existing website or mobile app.

In the next chapters we explain how to [change the layout of your schedule]({{< relref "choose-your-layout.md" >}}) , [set its colors]({{< relref "change-colors.md" >}}) or [add your own fonts]({{< relref "add-own-fonts.md" >}}) & [icons]({{< relref "replace-icons.md" >}}). So, [no time to waste]({{< relref "choose-your-layout.md" >}}).
