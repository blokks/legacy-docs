[When enabled](http://configure/options), an *Add to calendar* button will be visible at the top of your schedule. This button allows visitors to download and add the event to their calendar.

The download includes two types of calendar entries:
1. Entries for each of your event days.
2. Entries for each of your visitors favorite acts.

The calendar entries for each favorite act can be used as reminders, as they will trigger a notification **15 minutes** before the act or talk starts. On mobile, the *Add to calendar* button will automatically open your users' calender app, allowing them to add the calendar entries there.
