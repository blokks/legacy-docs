[When enabled]({{< relref "hide-components.md" >}}), an *Add to calendar* button will be visible at the top of your schedule. This button allows users to download and add event information to their calendar. The download includes entries for each day of your event. And for each of each act favorited.

The calendar entries for each favorite act can be used as reminders, as they will trigger a notification *15 minutes* before the act or talk starts. On mobile, the *Add to calendar* button will automatically open your users' calender app, allowing them to add the calendar entries there.
