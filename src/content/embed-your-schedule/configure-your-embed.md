Head over to the embed page when you’re ready to start implementing your schedule on your website or mobile app. Here you’ll find various settings that will allow you to customize both the design and functionality of your embed. All options are described in [the configure section](http://configure/options).

After adjusting the settings on the left, the embed code shown on the right will automatically update. So don’t forget to copy-paste the updated code if you change any of your settings.
