Head over to the embed page when you’re ready to start implementing your schedule. On this page you’ll find various settings that will allow you to customize both the design and functionality of your embed.

<span class='note'>Note: after adjusting the settings on the left, the embed code shown on the right will automatically update. So don’t forget to copy the updated code after you changed any of your settings.</span>
