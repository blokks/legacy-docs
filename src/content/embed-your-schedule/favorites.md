Your visitors are able to save their favorite acts and see where friends are going by connecting with their **Facebook**, **Twitter** or **LinkedIn** account. You can use the social provider of your choice by choosing one in the embed tab or by [setting it manually](http://configure/socialprovider).

## Adding favorites
Once connected click the *Add to favorites* button to favorite that act. Alternatively, you can double click acts to add favorites straight from the schedule.

## Friends activity
If some of your friends or colleagues are attending the same event, they will popup in several places. Telling you which speaker, band or performance they will see. Unfortunately **LinkedIn** doesn’t allow us to see user connections. Therefor it’s impossible for us to show your friends’ activity when using **LinkedIn** as your social provider. 🙁
