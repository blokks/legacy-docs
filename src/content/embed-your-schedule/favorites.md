Your visitors are able to save their favorite acts and see where their friends are going by connecting with their *Facebook*, *Twitter* or *LinkedIn* account. You can choose your social network using the [embed tab]({{< relref "configure-your-embed.md" >}}) or by [setting it manually]({{< relref "social-provider.md" >}}).

## Adding favorites
Once connected, visitors can click the *Add to favorites* button to favorite that act. Alternatively, they can double click acts or hit the <kbd>L</kbd> key to add favorites straight from the schedule.

## Friends activity
If some of your visitors' friends are attending the same event, they will popup in several places in your schedule. This will show your visitors which speaker, band or performance their friends are going to. 

<span class='note'>Note: Unfortunately **LinkedIn** does not allow us to see your visitors' connections. Because of this, we can't show friend activity when using **LinkedIn** as your social provider.</span>
