Blokks automatically looks for Google Analytics on your page. It uses your existing code to track Blokks events. Most websites already use Google Analytics. Which means you don’t have to do anything to make it work. It’s like magic ✨.

Visit the [Google Analytics website](https://analytics.google.com) for more information on how to install it on your website.
