Visitors can print the schedule including their favorites by clicking the *Print* button or by hitting <kbd>CTRL + P</kbd> or <kbd>CMD + P</kbd>. The schedule is automatically printed in a landscape layout. You can change this by adjusting the [data-print-orientation option](http://configure/print-orientation).
