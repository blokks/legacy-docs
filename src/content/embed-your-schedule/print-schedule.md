You can print the schedule including your favorites by clicking the *Print* button or hitting <kbd>CTRL + P</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>Command + P</kbd> on OSX. Your schedule is automatically printed in landscape. You can change this by setting the [data-print-orientation option](http://configure/print-orientation).
