Adding acts to your event is probably the most important part of building your schedule.

## Adding acts
To add an act, <span class='action'>simply click on an empty slot</span> in your timetable. This will bring up a screen where you can add and [edit all your info in one place]({{< relref "editing-acts.md" >}}).

## Moving and resizing acts
You can change the start time of an act by <span class='action'>moving it to a different slot</span>. Just pick it up by <span class='action'>clicking the top area of the act</span> and <span class='action'>drag it anywhere you want</span>. It will snap into place when you drop it.

Updating the end time of an act is done in a similar fashion. <span class='action'>Just click the bottom area</span> and start resizing the act. This will change the end time by increments of 15 minutes.

If you need to be more specific, you can do so by <span class='action'>[selecting the act]({{< relref "editing-acts.md#times" >}})</span> and change one of the times there.

*You should note that by dragging and resizing you may change other acts. And possibly remove them. Donâ€™t worry though, you can always undo a previous action by hitting <kbd><span class='ui'>CTRL+Z</span></kbd> or <kbd><span class='ui'>CMD+Z</span></kbd>*

## Deleting acts
You can delete an act by <span class='action'>pressing the <span class='ui'>Delete</span> button</span> at the bottom while editing an act. Alternatively, you can <span class='action'>right-click on any act</span> in your schedule to find another <span class='ui'>Delete</span> button.
