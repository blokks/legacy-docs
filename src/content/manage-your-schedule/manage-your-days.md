Your conference or festival can be a single or multiple day event. The dates can be found at the top of your schedule.

## Adding days
Adding extra days to your event is simple. Just hit the *+ Add day* button. Blokks will automatically pick the date that follows the last one.

<span class='note'>Note: your current stages will also be copied to your newly added day.</span>

## Changing and removing days
Right-clicking any date shows you the datepicker, allowing you to change the selected date. Click the *Remove* button right below the datepicker to delete that specific day. Removing days will also delete the acts (speakers, talks or artists) added to that day.

## Adjusting your start and end time
If you want your days to start earlier or end later, you can do so by clicking the *•••* button.

Changing the the start or end time of the day may remove acts from your schedule. Make sure that you don’t have any active acts during the hours you’re about to remove.
