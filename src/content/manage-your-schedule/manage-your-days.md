Your conference or festival can be a single or multiple day event. The dates can be found at the top of your schedule.

## Adding days
Adding extra days to your event is simple. Just hit the <span class='ui'>+ Add day</span> button. Blokks will automatically pick the date that follows the last one.

## Changing and removing days
<span class='action'>Right-click</span> any date will show the datepicker, allowing you to change the selected date. <span class='action'>Click the <span class='ui'>Remove</span> button</span> right below the datepicker to delete that specific day. Removing days will also delete the acts added to that day.

*Pro-tip: You can always undo any action by <span class='action'>clicking the <span class='ui'>Undo</span> button</span> in the top right or by using the shortcut <kbd><span class='ui'>CTRL+~</span></kbd> or <kbd><span class='ui'>CMD-Z</span></kbd>.*

## Adjusting your start and end time
If you want your days to start earlier or end later, you can do so by <span class='action'>clicking the <span class='ui'>•••</span> button</span>.

Changing the the start or end time of the day may remove acts from your schedule. Make sure that you don’t have any active acts during the hours you’re about to remove.
