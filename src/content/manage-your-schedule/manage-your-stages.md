The columns shown in your schedule represent the stages or areas of your event. 

## Adding stages
You can add stages by simply clicking the *+ Add new stage* button. New stages are added only to your currently selected day.

<span class='note'>Note: [Adding an extra day]({{< relref "manage-your-days.md#adding-days" >}}) will duplicate the stages of your currently selected day. To save you extra work, make sure you’ve created all stages before adding new dates.</span>

## Ordering stages
Changing the order of your stages is done by clicking the stage title and dragging the stage to the prefered position.

## Updating stages
Right-click a stage or press the *•••* button to bring up the various options for that stage.

### Titles and subtitles
The title field is required and will appear in your embedded schedule. The stage subtitle is an optional field. It’s used when more context is needed. For example, your stage name could be **The Red Stage** and its subtitle could be **Sponsored by Red Bull**.

<span class='note'>Pro-tip: Edit stage titles without opening the popup by <kbd>CTRL</kbd> or <kbd>CMD</kbd> clicking the title.</span>

### Categories
You can add one or more categories to your stages. By itself, these categories have no direct impact on the design of your timetable. But: categories can be used to [style the look and feel of each individual stage](http://design/styling).

### Delays
Live events can be pretty hectic and get messy at times. Speakers or artists can be delayed for various reasons, causing your schedule to get out of sync.

To better deal with this, it’s possible to add delays to stages. Delays are automatically added to all acts (speakers, talks or artists) of the delayed stage. For example, adding a delay of **15 minutes** pushes the start end times of all acts by 15 minutes.

Your users will see the updated times in their schedule, making sure they won’t be waiting around or be late to see their favorite acts.

<span class='note'>Note: times shown in the backend will still be the initially set times.</span>
