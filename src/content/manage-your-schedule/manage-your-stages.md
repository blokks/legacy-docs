The columns shown in your schedule represent the stages or areas of your event.

## Adding stages
You can add stages by simply <span class='action'>clicking</span> the <span class='ui'>+ Add new stage</span> button. New stages are added only to your current selected date.

*Note: [Adding an extra date]({{< relref "manage-your-days.md#adding-days" >}}) will duplicate the stages of that day. To save you from extra work, make sure you’ve created all stages before adding new dates.*

## Ordering stages
Changing the order of your stages is done by <span class='action'>clicking</span> the stage title and <span class='action'>drag ’n dropping</span> thspan to the prefered position. <span class='action'>Releasing</span> it will make it snap into position.

## Updating stages
<span class='action'>Right-click</span> a stage or press the <span class='ui'>•••</span> button to bring up the various options for that stage.

### Titles and subtitles
The title field is required and will appear in the spanbedded schedule. The stage subtitle is an optional field. It’s used when more context is needed. For example, your stage name could be <span class='input'>The Red Stage</span> and its subtitle could be <span class='input'>Sponsored by Red Bull</span>.

*Pro-tip: Edit stage titles without opening the popup by <kbd><span class='ui'>CTRL</span></kbd> or <kbd><span class='ui'>CMD</span></kbd> clicking its title.*

### Categories
You can add one or more categories to stages. By itself, these categories have no direct impact on the design of your timetable. But: categories can be used to [style the look and feel of each individual stage](http://design/styling).

### Delays
Live events can be pretty hectic and get messy at times. Speakers or artists can be delayed for various reasons, causing your schedule to get out of sync.

Therefor it’s possible to add delays to stages. Delays are automatically added to all acts of the delayed stage. For example, adding a delay of <span class='input'>15 minutes</span> pushes the start end times of all acts by 15 minutes.

Your visitors will see the updated times in their schedule, making sure they won’t be waiting around or be late to see their favorite acts.

*Note: times shown in the backend will still be the initially set times.*
