When saving your schedule we only update the data that actually changed. So you can work simultaneously with other people on your schedule, without overwriting each others changes. When using Blokks, your schedule will be automatically saved in the background every **3 minutes**.

When you accidentally close Blokks before your changes are saved, Blokks will show a popup reminding you to save your data before leaving.

## Exporting your data
Itâ€™s possible to export all the schedule data to Excel format. You can download this file by clicking the *Export* button on the top right.
