When saving your schedule we only update the data that actually changed. You can work simultaneously with other people on your schedule, without overwriting their changes. When using Blokks, your schedule will be automatically saved in the background every **3 minutes**.

When you accidentally close Blokks before your changes were saved, Blokks will show a popup reminding you to save your data before leaving.

## Exporting your data
Itâ€™s possible to export all the schedule data to an Excel format. You can download this file by clicking the *Export* button on the top right. The layout of the Excel file is fixed and cannot be customized.
