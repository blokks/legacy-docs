In the *Team* tab, you’ll find all the teams you’re currently a part of. You can invite new members by clicking the *Invite member* button. Simply add their email and hit send. Your new team member will then receive an email with their login credentials.

To remove a member from your team, hover over their name and click the *remove* button that appears on the right.

<span class='note'>Note: While on a free account your schedule is only visible to the members of your team. However, you can add as many members as you wish.</span>
