After first signing up to Blokks, you’ll be on a free account. With a free account, you’ll have access to all of Blokks’ features: you can add your schedule data, embed your schedule and customize it fully. But, your schedule will only be visible to you and your team members.

[Upgrade your account](https://blokks.co/manage/upgrades) once you’re ready to go live and share your schedule with your visitors.

Upgrading is quite simple. Just add your payment information, optionally add a coupon code, and you’re good to go! After processing your payment data, your schedule will be upgraded and visible to the public.
