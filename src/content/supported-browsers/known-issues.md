## Flexbox
*CSS Flexbox* is a layout mode which offers an alternative to, for example `floats`. It provides a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute items in a container. Blokks uses *Flexbox* to define the overall appearance of the embedded timetable. 

*Flexbox* is supported by all modern browsers. Only older Android Browsers and Internet Explorer 8-9 lack support. We recommend those people to update their browser as soon as possible.

<span class='note'>Supported by: *Chrome 49+* *Edge 12+* *Internet Explorer 10+* *Firefox 31+* *Safari 6.1+*</span>

## Sticky headers
`Position: sticky` is a CSS property which allow elements to stick to the viewport edge as you scroll past them.

Blokks implements [*sticky headers*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Sticky_positioning) as a progressive enhancement. Meaning that if your browser doesnâ€™t support *sticky headers*, they simply wonâ€™t stick. No polyfill or fallback is required.

<span class='note'>Please note that there are limitations to sticky headers. For example, they will not work inside elements with `overflow: scroll` or `auto`. Therefor, headers will not stick if [*data-local-scroll*](http://configure/local-scroll) is enabled.</span>

<span class='note'>Supported by: *Chrome 58+* *Edge 16+* *Firefox32+* *Safari 7+*</span>

## CSS Variables
Blokks is highly customizable through *CSS Variables*. It doesnâ€™t require *Less*, *Sass*, or any preprocessing at all. With *CSS variables* itâ€™s quite easy to, for example, [change colors]({{< relref "change-colors.md" >}}) and [add own fonts]({{< relref "add-own-fonts.md" >}}).

*CSS Variables* are supported by all major browsers, including Microsoft Edge. However, Internet Explorer has no support. Have a look at [Using CSS classes]({{< relref "using-css-classes.md" >}}) if you need older browsers support.

<span class='note'>Supported by: *Chrome 49+* *Edge 15+* *Firefox 31+* *Safari 9.1+*</span>

## Promises
Blokks uses [*Promises*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) extensively to handle so called async operations. What they are and what they do is beyond the scope of this page. What you should know is that they arenâ€™t supported by Internet Explorer. Luckily, adding the [Promise polyfill]({{< relref "using-polyfills.md#promises" >}}) will fix this ðŸ¤˜.

If you want to know more about *Promises*, [this article](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises) will bring you up to speed.

<span class='note'>Supported by: *Chrome 33+* *Edge 12+* *Firefox 29+* *Safari 7.1+*</span>

## MatchMedia
[*MatchMedia*](https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) is an API for finding out whether or not a media query applies to the document. Blokks uses *MatchMedia* to change layout when switching between mobile and desktop. 

There is a [polyfill available]({{< relref "using-polyfills.md#matchmedia" >}}) if you need to support Internet Explorer 9 and lower.
