Blokks works on modern browsers like Chrome, Edge, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari. We support the two most recent versions of these browsers.

We test Blokks in all supported browsers, and we'll fix bugs that affect those. If you use Blokks on an older or unsupported browser, it doesn't necessarily mean that Blokks won't work, but there may be [noticeable issues]({{< relref "known-issues.md" >}}).
